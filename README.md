# HTTP Proxy Logger

HTTP Proxy Logger is a small reverse proxy that prints incoming HTTP requests
and outgoing responses to stdout. Bodies compressed with `gzip` or `deflate`
are automatically decompressed in the logs so that you can easily inspect them.

## Example output

## Building

The project requires **Go 1.23**.

### Build a binary

```bash
go build -o http-proxy-logger
```

### Build a Docker image

```bash
docker build -t stn1slv/http-proxy-logger .
```

## Running

Set the `TARGET` environment variable to the upstream server and optionally
`PORT` for the listen address. You can run the proxy either directly or inside
a Docker container.

### Local execution

```bash
TARGET=http://example.com PORT=8888 ./http-proxy-logger
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 \
  -e PORT=8888 \
  -e TARGET=http://demo7704619.mockable.io \
  stn1slv/http-proxy-logger
```

The proxy will forward traffic to the target and log each request/response pair
using the format shown above.
